IAGO </br> I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason </br> 
To show the <span style="color:pink;">love and duty</span> that I bear you </br>
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,</br>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</br>
Look to your wife; <span style="color:pink;">observe her well</span> with Cassio;</br>
Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.</br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,</br>
Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.</br>
I know our country disposition well.</br>
In Venice they do let God see the pranks</br>
They dare not show their husbands. Their best</br>
conscience</br>
Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.</p>

Iago first introduces the idea of Desdemona with Cassio by flattering Othello in order to gain his trust. This manipulation tactic is seen in Iago's actions throughout the play to get Othello on his side and make sure he will believe Iago's accusations towards Desdemona. Iago frames his 'warning' to Othello as something he is telling him out of love in order to protect him, and Othello is quick to fall victim to this manipulation. </p>

OTHELLO</br>  Dost thou say so?</p>
IAGO </br>
She did <span style="color:pink;">deceive</span> her father, marrying you,</br>
And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,</br>
She loved them most.</p>
OTHELLO </br> And so she did.</p>
IAGO </br> Why, go to, then!</br>
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</br>
To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,</br>
He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to</br>
blame.</br>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</br>
For<span style="color:pink;"> too much loving you</span>.</p>

Iago continues to manipulate Othello by using Othello's past experiences with Desdemona to lead him to think that Desdemona is unfaithful, even though the unbiased audience is aware that Desdemona's lie to her father proves her love for Othello, while Iago's accusations would directly contradict that value.

OTHELLO </br> I am <span style="color:pink;">bound</span> to thee <span style="color:pink;">forever</span>.</p> 
IAGO </br>
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.</p>
OTHELLO </br>
Not a jot, not a jot.</p>
IAGO </br> I’ faith, I fear it has.</br>
I hope you will consider what is spoke</br>
Comes from <span style="color:pink;">my love</span>. But I do see you’re moved.</br>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech</br>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach</br>
Than to suspicion.</p>
OTHELLO </br> I will not.</p>
IAGO </br> Should you do so, my lord,</br>
My speech should fall into such vile success</br>
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my <span style="color:pink;">worthy</br>
friend</span> .</br>
My lord, I see you’re moved.</p>
OTHELLO  </br>No, not much moved.</br>
I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</p>
IAGO </br>
Long live she so! And long live you to think so!</p>
OTHELLO </br>
And yet, how nature erring from itself—</p>
IAGO </br>
Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,</br>
Not to affect many proposèd matches</br>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</br>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends—</br>
Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,</br>
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—</br>
But pardon me—I do not in position</br>
Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</br>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</br>
May fall to match you with her country forms</br>
And happily repent.</p>

The end of this excerpt shows that Iago has fully earned Othello's trust with his manipulation. He has successfully convinced Othello that his warnings are purely out of love and that Othello has something to worry about with Desdemona. </section> </p>
