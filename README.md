# Othello 3.3
I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason </br>
To show the love and duty that I bear you </br>
With franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,</br>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</br>
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</br>
Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.</br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,</br>
Out of self-bounty, be abused. Look to ’t.</br>
I know our country disposition well.</br>
In Venice they do let God see the pranks</br>
They dare not show their husbands. Their best</br>
conscience</br>
Is not to leave ’t undone, but keep ’t unknown.</br>
OTHELLO  Dost thou say so?</br>
IAGO </br>
She did deceive her father, marrying you,</br>
And when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,</br>
She loved them most.</br>
OTHELLO  And so she did.</br>
IAGO  Why, go to, then!</br>
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</br>
To seel her father’s eyes up close as oak,</br>
He thought ’twas witchcraft! But I am much to</br>
blame.</br>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</br>
For too much loving you.</br>
OTHELLO  I am bound to thee forever.</br>
IAGO </br>
I see this hath a little dashed your spirits.</br>
OTHELLO </br>
Not a jot, not a jot.</br>
IAGO  I’ faith, I fear it has.</br>
I hope you will consider what is spoke</br>
Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved.</br>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech</br>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach</br>
Than to suspicion.</br>
OTHELLO  I will not.</br>
IAGO  Should you do so, my lord,</br>
My speech should fall into such vile success</br>
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy</br>
friend.</br>
My lord, I see you’re moved.</br>
OTHELLO  No, not much moved.</br>
I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</br>
IAGO </br>
Long live she so! And long live you to think so!</br>
OTHELLO </br>
And yet, how nature erring from itself—</br>
IAGO </br>
Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,</br>
Not to affect many proposèd matches</br>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</br>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends—</br>
Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,</br>
Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural—</br>
But pardon me—I do not in position</br>
Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</br>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</br>
May fall to match you with her country forms</br>
And happily repent.</br>
